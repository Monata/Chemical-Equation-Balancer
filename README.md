# Chemical-Equation-Balancer
This is a C program that calculates the coefficents for the given unbalanced equation
It takes the equation as a whole and you have to specify the right side with "->"
ex: H20 + CO2 -> C6H12O6 + O2
You can also use paranthesis
H3PO4+(NH4)2MoO4 + HNO3 -> (NH4)3PO4(MoO3)12 + NH4NO3 + H2O
it will give the result like
1 12 21 1 21 12

Since this uses Montante's method to calculate the linear equations, the input must have a solution,
if it doesn't have one the program don't handle the error and closes.

If you run into any errors please let me know.
